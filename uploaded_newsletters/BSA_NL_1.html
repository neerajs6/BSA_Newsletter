Data Combination for Problem-solving: A Case of an Open Data Exchange Platform
Authors: Teruaki Hayashi, Hiroki Sakaji, Hiroyasu Matsushima, Yoshiaki Fukami, Takumi Shimizu, Yukio Ohsawa
Many studies have discussed the economic and utility value of data and data exchange but the characteristics of data that contribute to problem solving through data combination have not been fully understood
In big data and interdisciplinary data combinations large scale data with many variables are expected to be used and value is expected to be created by combining data as much as possible
The findings of this study shed light on mechanisms behind data combination for problem solving involving multiple datasets and variables
Taking Principles Seriously: A Hybrid Approach to Value Alignment
Authors: Tae Wan Kim, John Hooker, Thomas Donaldson
An important step in the development of value alignment systems in ai is understanding how va can reflect valid ethical principles
We propose that designers of va systems incorporate ethics by utilizing a hybrid approach in which both ethical reasoning and empirical observation play a role
This permits empirical va to integrate seamlessly with independently justified ethical principles
Facebook Ad Engagement in the Russian Active Measures Campaign of 2016

We aimed to unearth the relationship between ad engagement and 41 features related to ads metadata sociolinguistic structures and sentiment
We found that ad expenditure text size ad lifetime and sentiment were the top features predicting users engagement to the ads
Additionally positive sentiment ads were more engaging than negative ads and sociolinguistic features were identified as highly important in the makeup of an engaging ad
Fast Physical Activity Suggestions: Efficient Hyperparameter Learning in Mobile Health
Authors: Marianne Menictas, Sabina Tomkins, Susan Murphy
Users can be supported to adopt healthy behaviors such as regular physical activity via relevant and timely suggestions on their mobile devices
We propose an algorithm for providing physical activity suggestions in mhealth settings
Using domain science we formulate a contextual bandit algorithm which makes use of a linear mixed effects model

Fairness, Welfare, and Equity in Personalized Pricing
Authors: Nathan Kallus, Angela Zhou
We study the interplay of fairness welfare and equity considerations in personalized pricing based on customer features
These different application areas may lead to different concerns around fairness welfare and equity on different objectives price burdens on consumers price envy firm revenue access to a good equal access and distributional consequences when the good in question further impacts downstream outcomes of interest
We empirically demonstrate the potential benefits of personalized pricing in two settings pricing subsidies for an elective vaccine and the effects of personalized interest rates on downstream outcomes in microcredit
Social Media COVID-19 Misinformation Interventions Viewed Positively, But Have Limited Impact
Authors: Christine Geeng, Tiona Francisco, Jevin West, Franziska Roesner
Amidst covid 19 misinformation spreading social media platforms like facebook and twitter rolled out design interventions including banners linking to authoritative resources and more specific false information labels
In late march 2020 shortly after these interventions began to appear we conducted an exploratory mixed methods survey to learn what are social media users attitudes towards these interventions and to what extent do they self report effectiveness we found that most participants indicated a positive attitude towards interventions particularly post specific labels for misinformation
Still the majority of participants discovered or corrected misinformation through other means most commonly web searches suggesting room for platforms to do more to stem the spread of covid 19 misinformation</p>
